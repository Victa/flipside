# Flip Side

Flip Side is an iOS app that helps you identify and learn about your vinyl records. Simply take a photo of a record cover or label, and the app uses AI to extract the album information, match it with Discogs, and provide community insights from social media.

This is a personal project built with SwiftUI.
